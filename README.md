# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

Predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) for e-commerce businesses using machine learning.

## About

This project aims to predict how valuable a customer will be over their entire relationship with the business. I'm using historical purchase data to train models that can identify high-value customers and help businesses make better marketing decisions.

## What I'm Building

- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation
- Machine learning models to predict future customer value
- Interactive dashboard to visualize insights
- Simple API for making predictions

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- pandas, numpy for data processing
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM for modeling
- Streamlit for dashboard
- FastAPI for the prediction API

## Dataset

Working with a synthetic e-commerce dataset containing:
- Customer purchase history
- Transaction details (date, amount, product category)
- Customer behavior metrics
- Around 40,000 transaction records

## Current Progress

- [x] Project setup and requirements
- [ ] Data generation script
- [ ] EDA notebooks
- [ ] Feature engineering
- [ ] Model training and comparison
- [ ] Dashboard development
- [ ] API implementation

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jaimin-prajapati-ds/clv-prediction-system.git
cd clv-prediction-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Coming soon... still working on it!

## Planned Features

1. Customer segmentation dashboard
2. CLV prediction models (comparing RF, XGBoost, LightGBM)
3. Risk assessment for at-risk customers
4. Business recommendations based on customer segments

## Why This Project?

I wanted to learn more about:
- Building end-to-end ML projects
- Working with customer behavior data
- Creating practical business solutions with data science
- Deploying models with APIs

This is part of my data science learning journey. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
